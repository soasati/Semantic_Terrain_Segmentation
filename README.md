# Semantic_Terrain_Segmentation
This project is the course project of IPML(Image Processing with Machine Learning). The semantic terrain image segmentation project aims to enable the autonomous vehicle to understand the terrain it is traversing, differentiate between different types of terrain (e.g., grass, sand, rocks, water bodies, and obstacles), and plan its path accordingly. The objective is to develop a Deep Neural Network that performs semantic image segmentation and differentiates between the 4 categories based on robot mobility i.e. legged traversability, belted traversability, wheeled traversability, and non-traversable terrain. In our problem statement, we considered three robots equipped with different movement configurations; legs, belts, and wheels. Each robot has its advantages and disadvantages (constraints) regarding mobility. The primary focus is on what type of robot would suit the task/terrain when several robots with varying mobility are available.

# Technology Used
-> Deep Neural Network (U-NET) of Machine Learning

-> Designed, implemented, and modified U-NET architecture from scratch for multi-class segmentation using Cross Entropy Loss.

-> Performance metric - Mean Dice Score and Accuracy.
